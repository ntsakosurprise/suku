## 🔍 SUKU vs. jQuery

SUKU borrows jQuery’s philosophy of making common tasks easier but takes a lightweight, modern approach.

| Feature | jQuery | SUKU |
|--------|--------|------|
| Size | Larger | Much smaller |
| Dependencies | Requires jQuery core | None |
| Syntax | `$()` wrappers, chainable | Direct methods: `SUKU.method(el, ...)` |
| DOM Usage | Wrapped jQuery objects | Native DOM nodes |
| Features | DOM, events, AJAX, animations, plugins | DOM, HTML5 APIs, tables, JSON, dimensions, AJAX |
| Philosophy | Abstraction-heavy | Simple utilities |

If you enjoy jQuery’s convenience but want a zero-dependency utility library built for 2025+, SUKU is designed for you.
